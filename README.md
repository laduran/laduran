### Hi there üëã

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently on a career break (Sept 2023)
  - Before my career break I was working for [Intel](https://github.com/intel) doing client platform simulation using [Simics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/simics-simulator.html)
  - Before that I worked at [Banfield](https://www.banfield.com) and learned a lot about distributed systems, SQL, Angular, and Microsoft Azure
  - And before that I worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com)
  - I studied Computer Science in a MS program at [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu)
  - And I did Bachelor's degree also at UCSC in Applied Mathematics.
  - At UCSC, I did a lot of C programming using the book [Numerical Recipes in C](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-Scientific-Computing-Second/dp/0521431085) (PS: I lost my copy of that book ages ago and if anyone wanted to gift me a copy of it, I'd be most grateful!)
- When I'm not working I am teaching myself Machine Learning with Coursera courses taught by [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)
- Starting In January, I will be taking a series of [Machine Learning courses](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/machine-learning)
  from the [Univerity of Washington](https://www.uw.edu)
