### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 Last year (2023) I left a full-time job with Intel to focus on building my [consulting business](www.sylvansoftworks.com) and enhance my skills in Machine Learning
  - I recently completed this course in [Machine Learning courses](https://www.pce.uw.edu/certificates/machine-learning) from the [Univerity of Washington](https://www.uw.edu) as well as Coursera ML classes
  - Before my career break I was working for [Intel](https://github.com/intel) doing client platform simulation using [Simics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/simics-simulator.html)
  - Before Intel I was working at PacificStar Communications (a division of Curtiss-Wright) on [IQ-Core](https://www.curtisswrightds.com/products/networking-communications/pacstar/iq-core-software)
  - Before PacStar I worked at [Banfield](https://www.banfield.com) and learned a lot about distributed systems, SQL, Angular, and Microsoft Azure
  - And before that I worked at [Intel](https://www.intel.com) working on a lot of different projects that went nowhere: Larrabee, Anypoint, ProShare
  - I studied Computer Science in a MS program at [University of California Santa Cruz](https://www.ucsc.edu), but didn't complete it due to not completing the thesis requirement (oops!)
  - And I did Bachelor's degree also at UCSC in Applied Mathematics.
  - At UCSC, I did a lot of C programming using the book [Numerical Recipes in C](https://www.amazon.com/Numerical-Recipes-Scientific-Computing-Second/dp/0521431085) (PS: I lost my copy of that book ages ago and if anyone wanted to gift me a copy of it, I'd be most grateful!)


- ⚡ Fun facts:
  - I like to play classical/flamenco guitar with occasional forays into Metallica transciptions for classical guitar
  - I have a son who is studying Math and Biology in Australia
  - I was born on an 🏝️
  - But grew up in Colorado and California

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
  - Anything Machine Learning related
  - Currently working with a friend on a ML project to detect fake audio. (currently we are just in the research phase as of Oct 2024)
  - MAANG interviewing techniques (you know what I mean)
  - Email me at: [louis@sylvansoftworks.com](mailto:louis@sylvansoftworks.com)
